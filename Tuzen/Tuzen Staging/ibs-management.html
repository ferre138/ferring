        Your digestive system is a complex series of functions, processes and sensory stimulation.  Like all functioning systems, it is prone to problematic issues and disruptions.  If <a class="purple" href="IBS-facts.html">IBS</a> is your dysfunction, then you’ll be better able to deal it by understanding it better. 
        <br><br>
Keeping up on new developments in digestive health related to IBS is the best way to manage IBS.  See your doctor, your dietitian or healthcare provider regularly to monitor symptoms and identify any new shifts in triggers. Enlist the support and understanding of family and friends, co-workers and employers.  By educating them on the nature of your unique symptoms you can alleviate any stigma that may exist about having IBS. Maintain a strong and positive attitude.  It will help you through a long and sometimes emotionally challenging process.

		  There is an investigative process of identifying triggers in food and developing a diet plan that will work for you. By following it, you can reduce the number of flares you experience and alleviate symptoms when they do occur.
		  <br><br>
		  Your bowel will react to the foods you eat as well as when you eat.  It’s important to eat regularly even though you may not feel like it. A few small meals throughout the day will help regulate your digestive system and reduce bathroom visits.

            Some IBS patients experience problematic extra sensitivity to the building and passage of gas, causing pain and discomfort.  This can be alleviated somewhat by avoiding the ingestion of air through chewing gum, eating quickly, washing down food with large quantities of liquids, sipping hot drinks and eating gas producing foods such as broccoli, cabbage and beans.  Limit your intake of low-calorie sweeteners as they can cause gas, abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhea.  Avoid alcohol sugars especially (any sweetener ending in "itol").

            </div> 
            Some IBS patients may find taking gas reducing medications will help.  Normally, you would not have to eliminate all gas producing foods completely but simply reduce the amount you consume.  These foods are still a good source of nutrients and fiber which your body needs.
            <br><br>
            Lactose intolerance is a common factor in IBS.  Lactose is the sugar in milk which some people have difficulty processing.  The body requires an enzyme called lactase to digest milk properly.  If your system does not produce this natural enzyme, it will not digest the lactose and in turn you will suffer excess gas and bloating.  Lactase supplements are readily available and may be a good option for IBS patients who want to continue to drink milk and consume milk products.

         <h2>Including Fiber in your Diet</h2>  
         <h3>
         Fiber is sometimes problematic to IBS sufferers but it is a necessary dietary component for a healthy digestive system. Start with small amounts and increase fiber content as your system adapts to it.  You may wish to introduce a fiber supplement such as Benefiber&reg;, Metamucil&reg; or other similar product.  Check the fiber content in food and the type of fiber.

		Soluble fiber dissolves in water and slows the process of elimination of the bowel and is helpful for IBS-D patients with diarrhea.
        <br><br>
        Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water and increases stool bulk, accelerating transit time and relieving constipation.  This fiber should be the choice for the IBS-C patient.

            	We have all heard of our “central” nervous system.  It controls our 5 senses and communicates when we feel pain, we are frightened, tired, hungry, cold or hot.  It tells our limbs to move, our eyes to open and close, our fingers to pick up things.  It is basically our body’s control centre.
                <br><br>
                Your gut has its own nervous system called the “enteric nervous system”.  It regulates the digestion and processing of the foods we ingest.  Our enteric nervous system communicates with the central nervous system and tells it how it feels.  If you are feeling distressed, anxious or depressed, it may affect your bowel system causing symptoms such as gas, bloating, diarrhea or constipation or even the urgency to empty your bowel.
                <br><br>
                It is important to control these reactions by practicing relaxing techniques and not anticipating negative outcomes.  Exercise and rest is key to reducing flares.

                Medical research continues to evaluate methods of treatment to help IBS patients. Some IBS cases may require treatment with medications and your physician may prescribe products or recommend supplements to regulate your symptoms.    Medications such as pinaverium bromide and trimebutine maleate are designed to address motility issues such as the contraction process of the bowel and help synchronize the muscle movement of the bowel.   Pinaverium bromide is particularly helpful in reducing bloating, constipation, abdominal pain and diarrhea.  Trimebutine maleate specifically slows the movement of the bowel.

	      <h3> There is growing evidence of the benefits of taking probiotics.  This option is being explored for several digestive system disorders.  It has been clinically proven to reduce or eliminate symptoms of IBS. <br>
	        <br>
	        Probiotics are living microorganisms (good bacteria) that exist naturally in the human gut and are essential in normal gastrointestinal functions. Probiotics are commonly referred to as gut flora. Research shows that certain chronic intestinal disorders are due to an imbalance in good and bad bacteria in the gut.  Probiotics re-establish a balance in your gastrointestinal eco system.  These are quickly becoming the common go-to solution to replace antibiotics. </h3>

            Many marketed products such as yogurt and other supplements may contain a certain amount of probiotics but often do not provide adequate potency of probiotics to deliver sufficient and substantial benefits to IBS patients.  However, there are some clinically-tested and proven probiotic products that can be an effective addition to IBS management.  The key matter is in selecting a product that not only provides potency but also survives stomach acids in your gut.  Most commercial products’ potency is destroyed shortly after ingestion.

Lactobacillus reuteri has also been found effective for reducing the effects of colic in infants. <br><br>
