        IBS not only affects the sufferer, it also affects the people around you – family, friends, co-workers, employers, and basically anyone that may interact with you.  
        <br><br>
        Some of your symptoms such as urgency, diarrhea and gas can cause some social discomfort and embarrassment, leaving you feeling anxious, leaving you wanting to confine yourself to home and never leave.  
        <br><br>
        Embarrassing incidents leave you even more nervous about social interaction and the simplest things like grocery shopping can be a challenge.  Imagine shopping for clothes and worrying about having an episode while trying something on.  Or attending a family event and not being able to eat or drink because you know you will be running to the bathroom every few minutes. Or dreading going on a date because in your mind, you are sure you will have an embarrassing episode.
        
        <br><br>
        Imagine being like this all your life, every day.  “Why me?”

                IBS is a condition you have, it’s not who you are. Instead of shame, you should feel compassion toward yourself. You’re as deserving as anyone to enjoy life.  Others may feel uncomfortable about talking about it at first, but if they know they’ll be more helpful and understanding.  
                <br><br>
                IBS can affect your mood, your daily activities and energy level along with your general well-being.  You may feel ostracized and feel that people are avoiding you.  You may want to just stay away from people because you feel embarrassed or that may be imposing on others.  
                <br><br>

                </div> 
                Simple outings can become complicated and managing the symptoms can sometimes be a struggle.  But there are ways to help you cope.  You and your healthcare provider can work together to identify what triggers the symptoms and develop a plan that will work for you.  Taking care of YOU is the most important step.  Maintaining good health will not only reduce your symptoms but also your stress level.  
                <br><br>
                Living with IBS becomes simpler when you accept the fact that your life will be different. You will learn to adjust accordingly. Some steps may be simpler than others.  You can start by not worrying about when your next flare will happen. Follow simple guidelines but don’t stop living.
