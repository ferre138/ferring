<h3>I have to write this testimonial. I had a routine colonoscopy and everything was OK, but after a while I started having diarrhea and blood for a long time. Eventually I also started looking into fecal transplant therapy. I asked my doctor if I could try VSL#3, as I knew someone else taking it who strongly recommended it. After 2 weeks, taking 2 packages a day, the diarrhea and blood stopped. I still continue in the study for fecal transplant therapy, but there is no doubt that VSL#3 has made a huge difference. I recommend it for anyone with any kind of bowel issues. I tried other types of probiotics and none of them helped. Please do yourself a favour and try it for at least 2 or 3 weeks... what do you have to lose?</h3>

<h3>We had my 9 year old son on the GAPS diet for autism for 4 months, we had noticed some mild improvements with diet alone, and then in the fourth month we found VSL#3, which was recommended by Dr. Bryce Wylde. He has now been through 3 boxes, he takes it twice a day. The difference in him is REMARKABLE! Probiotics and diet are changing my son's life. It's a financial burden but worth every penny in the end. I highly recommend this product and omitting irritating foods. </h3>

<h3>I tried all the treatments available and imaginable (Pentasa, Imuran, Remicade, Humira, and different types of steroids) without any noticeable improvement except for high dosage of the steroids but the use long term will damage the body.<br>
<br>
I also tried all sorts of natural/holistic treatments including  probiotics, hypnotherapy, acupuncture, shiatsu treatments without any relief.<br>
<br>
Then I saw a Father's testimony of his son's experience: after an operation the boy took VSL#3 and his condition improved considerably, I wanted to try
it.<br>
<br>
I have been taking VSL#3 for the past 3 months (1 sachet at the end of my supper). Within one week of taking VSL#3, I was sleeping through the night,
which has not happened for many years.  During the day I have a lot less abdominal pain and less urgency to go to the bathroom (during the flare-ups
I was going 15 times a day with blood).<br>
<br>
I am feeling a lot better today with less pain and have the sensation of being well physically.<br>
<br>
I cannot promise that VSL#3 will work for everyone the way it did for me, but VSL#3 is a godsend.</h3>

<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
<div class="outline-testimonial"><h2 class="h2-testimonials">"The positive effects from the medication have virtually changed my life."</h2>
<h3>I am an ileal pouch patient for over 20 years due to complications from ulcerative colitis. Since then I have had to deal with severe morning toxicity, excessive bloating problems, and multiple trips (up to 5 a day) to the bathroom. I was also sick half the year from flues and colds which I could not shake.
<br><br>
In Jan 2008 I started taking VSL3. The positive effects from the medication have virtually changed my life. I am no longer toxic in the morning, the bloating is significantly less and I go to the bathroom as little as twice a day. The endless flues and colds have stopped and my overall health is fantastic compared to before VSL3.
<br><br>
I would strongly encourage anyone who has intestinal tract problems to try VSL3. Give yourself enough time to make sure it works for you. In my case I could feel the difference after 2 weeks and felt the full benefits after about 6 weeks. I started off with 4 packs a day eventually cutting back to 2 daily. I bumped it back to 3 packets daily because it made a big difference in how I feel. Occasionally I let a few days lapse before re-ordering and that turned out to be a mistake. It took me only 1 day of missing my dose to feel things sliding back.</h3>
